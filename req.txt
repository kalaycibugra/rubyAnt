// ************ Meadow
// simulation ends when there is a single colony left
// 15x15 grid
// each grid element has a cell which can have a single anthill within
// [------INIT------]]
// 4 anthill only
// Queen randomly selects cell to build her anthill (Builder Pattern)
//

// ************ Anthill / Cell
// [[------INIT------]]
// food = inits with 0 food
// ants = Array.new max size = 15!
// hill = nill
// 5 pieces of food on start
// if an anthill has 0 foragers it gets destroyed at the end of turn
// ** Each anthill has its own semi-unique algorithm to decide what should be created next
// At least 3 different creation strategy

// ************************** Ants
// moves 1 square each return randomly
// single room for each ant which costs 1 food and 1 builder ant to create

// [[-----------forager---------------]]
// food is instantly added to its anthill no hike back
// experience each time he finds food
// [[-----------warrior----------------]]
// if finds a forager 50% he kills the forager
// warrior also has xp but fight are decided randomly depending on the xp attribute
// when warrior enters another anthill 1/5 chance that it destroys the anthill => that anthill's all habitants instantly die
// builder -- creates rooms inside the anthill
// [[-----------builder----------------]]
// can create rooms where each room spawns ants every turn there is available food
